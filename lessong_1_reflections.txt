I actually forget the question at this point. Oh yeah, No I remember. Why does a process like the 'diff' command make such a difference?

It is because it allows me to easily find th parts that changed.

If you have a problem with a program, and something didn't work after your last update. You can quickley find a change.

Once that change is found, you can fix it.

Very helpful with Typos.
