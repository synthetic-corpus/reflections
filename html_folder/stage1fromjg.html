    <h1>Welcome to my Webpage</h1>
    <p>
      This is my first project to turn in for Udacity.<br>
      Having not worked in raw HTML since the early 2000s,
      I wonder who this will look.<br>
      ...<em>On to the notes!</em>

<!-- Regarding group your notes into larger catargories...
... I definitely feel like I did that already.

I will add a Scann with a class 'quote' to fromatt with CSS later-->

      <h2>Why computers are stupid</h2>
      <p>
        A computer, unlike a human, can only be instructed in a precise grammar.
        <br>
        Humans can understand that the following setnances:
        <blockquote>
          <scan class=quote>
          "I have been here all afternoon"
          <br>
          "I been here all day"
          <br>
          "Here is where I have been, throughout the day."
          </scan>
        </blockquote>
        All mean the same thing. A computer would not understand the second statement.
        <br>
        Computers are also stupid that they cannot understand context or emphasis.
        <blockquote>
          <scan class=quote>
          "<b>How</b> could she do it?"
          <br>
          "How could <b>she</b> do it?"
          <br>
          "How could she do <b>it?</b>"
          </scan>
        </blockquote>
          These sentances will be understood differently by humans.
          <br>
          To a stupid computer, they are all the same.
      <h2>Qualities of Tags</h2>
      <p>
        There are <b>Void tags,</b> and <b>paried tags</b>
        <br>
        Though the name is confusing, <b>Void tags</b> do not mean
        that they are tags that do nothing. Rather, it means tags
        that do not require a closing statement.
        <br>
        They are "void" in the sense that there is no opening or closing.
        <br>
        Examples of void tags are the img and br tags.
        <br>
        <b>Paired tags</b> are tags that always appear in pairs:
        An open tag and close tag. Information is placed in between them.
        <br>
          <blockqutoe>
            <scan class=quote>
            E.g. <sometag>Here is a little text</sometag>
            </scan>
          </blockquote>
          <br>
          Examples of self closing tags are a, b, em, and html.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are <b>inline tags</b> and there are <b>block tags.</b>
          <br>
          <b>Inline tags</b> make a change in the lines of text.
          <br>
          <b>Block tags</b> will create an invisible box around the text.
          <br>
          This box can have additional qualities added to it.
          <br>
          Examples of inline are b, em, and span. Examples of block are p, blockquote and div.
        </p>
        <h2>Div and Span</h2>
        <p>
          Div and Span are paired tags.
          <br>
          They are generic tags that operated as block or inline respectively.
          <br>
          Each tag does nothing until given additional instructions via CSS.
          <br>
          CSS is beyond the scope of the lesson I just completed.
