What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Answer: Automatic Merging is quick and easy. It is best done when one branch's code do not overlap with another branch's code. That is only one of the two branches changes the common ancestor. While the other only adds new code.

Manual merging is probably the best and important when more than one person is working on a code. Or when a new branch is created to perhaps clean up previous code. E.g. Turning long sections of code into fuctions/processes, refractoring, etc.
